      <description>This site is just a playground to learn hugo, how it works and the workflow. Also, since the generated site is just a collection of static web pages, this site is hosted on github as github pages and gets automatically deployed at every commit to the master branch.
The hugo project for this site is at the source branch. Every commit to this branch triggers a travis build, where the new pages are generated and with some custom deployment shell commands, the generated pages are committed to master branch.</description>
